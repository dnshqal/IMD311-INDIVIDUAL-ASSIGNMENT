            <h3 class="header2">I attended and studied in SMK Kajang Utama for 5 years, got promoted to become <br> a librarian prefect and also school prefect in my final year. <br>
            Later on, I got decent results for my SPM and got an opportunity to further my<br>studies in UiTM Jengka as a pre-diploma student for 1 semester.<br>
            <br> After a hectic semester in pre-diploma, I managed to get a dean and continued to<br>further my studies in UiTM Rembau as a Diploma student in Information Science<br>
            Now, my journey as a university student and a proud UiTM student is almost at its end,<br>I hope that all of this memories with my friends and lecturer remains in my mind and for<br>them aswell in future.<br>
